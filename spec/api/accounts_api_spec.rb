  # Get and search all accounts
  # Get bank accounts of the user that is authorized by the access_token. Must pass the user&#39;s access_token. You can set optional search criteria to get only those bank accounts that you are interested in. If you do not specify any search criteria, then this service functions as a &#39;get all&#39; service.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [Array<Integer>] :ids A comma-separated list of account identifiers. If specified, then only accounts whose identifier match any of the given identifiers will be regarded. The maximum number of identifiers is 1000.
  # @option opts [String] :search If specified, then only those accounts will be contained in the result whose &#39;accountName&#39;, &#39;iban&#39;, &#39;accountNumber&#39; or &#39;subAccountNumber&#39; contains the given search string (the matching works case-insensitive). If no accounts contain the search string in any of these fields, then the result will be an empty list. NOTE: If the given search string consists of several terms (separated by whitespace), then ALL of these terms must be contained in the searched fields in order for an account to get included into the result.
  # @option opts [Array<Integer>] :account_type_ids A comma-separated list of account types. If specified, then only accounts that relate to the given types will be regarded. If not specified, then all accounts will be regarded.
  # @option opts [Array<Integer>] :bank_connection_ids A comma-separated list of bank connection identifiers. If specified, then only accounts that relate to the given bank connections will be regarded. If not specified, then all accounts will be regarded.
  # @option opts [String] :min_last_successful_update Lower bound for a account&#39;s last successful update date, in the format &#39;YYYY-MM-DD&#39; (e.g. &#39;2016-01-01&#39;). If specified, then only accounts whose &#39;lastSuccessfulUpdate&#39; is equal to or later than the given date will be regarded.
  # @option opts [String] :max_last_successful_update Upper bound for a account&#39;s last successful update date, in the format &#39;YYYY-MM-DD&#39; (e.g. &#39;2016-01-01&#39;). If specified, then only accounts whose &#39;lastSuccessfulUpdate&#39; is equal to or earlier than the given date will be regarded.
  # @option opts [Float] :min_balance If specified, then only accounts whose balance is equal to or greater than the given balance will be regarded. Can contain a positive or negative number with at most two decimal places. Examples: -300.12, or 90.95
  # @option opts [Float] :max_balance If specified, then only accounts whose balance is equal to or less than the given balance will be regarded. Can contain a positive or negative number with at most two decimal places. Examples: -300.12, or 90.95

  # unit tests for get_daily_balances
  # Get daily balances
  # Returns the user&#39;s daily balances for a given period and a set of specified accounts (or all accounts, if none are specified). The daily balances are calculated by finAPI and are based on the current balances of the regarded accounts.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [Array<Integer>] :account_ids A comma-separated list of (non-security) account identifiers. If no accounts are specified, all (non-security) accounts of the user are regarded.
  # @option opts [String] :start_date A string in the format &#39;YYYY-MM-DD&#39;. Note that the requested date range [startDate..endDate] may not exceed 365 days. If startDate is not specified, it defaults to the endDate minus one month.
  # @option opts [String] :end_date A string in the format &#39;YYYY-MM-DD&#39;. Note that the requested date range [startDate..endDate] may not exceed 365 days. If endDate is not specified, it defaults to today&#39;s date.
  # @option opts [BOOLEAN] :with_projection Whether finAPI should project the first and last actually existing balance of an account into the past and future. When passing &#39;true&#39;, then the result will always contain a daily balance for every day of the entire requested date range, even for days before the first actually existing balance, resp. after the last actually existing balance. Those days will have the same balance as the day of the first actual balance, resp. last actual balance, i.e. the first/last balance will be infinitely projected into the past/the future. When passing &#39;false&#39;, then the result will contain daily balances only from the day on where the first actual balance exists for any of the regarded accounts, and only up to the day where the last actual balance exists for any of the regarded accounts. Note that when in this case there are no actual balances within the requested date range, then an empty array will be returned. Default value for this parameter is &#39;true&#39;.
  # @option opts [Integer] :page Result page that you want to retrieve.
  # @option opts [Integer] :per_page Maximum number of records per page. Can be at most 500. NOTE: Due to its validation and visualization, the swagger frontend might show very low performance, or even crashes, when a service responds with a lot of data. It is recommended to use a HTTP client like Postman or DHC instead of our swagger frontend for service calls with large page sizes.
  # @option opts [Array<String>] :order Determines the order of the results. You can order the results by &#39;date&#39;, &#39;balance&#39;, &#39;income&#39; or &#39;spending&#39;. The default order for this service is &#39;date,asc&#39;. You can also order by multiple properties. In that case the order of the parameters passed is important. Example: &#39;/accounts/dailyBalances?order&#x3D;date,desc&amp;order&#x3D;balance,asc&#39; will return daily balances ordered by &#39;date&#39; (descending), where items with the same &#39;date&#39; are ordered by &#39;balance&#39; (ascending). The general format is: &#39;property[,asc|desc]&#39;, with &#39;asc&#39; being the default value. Please note that ordering by multiple fields is not supported in our swagger frontend, but you can test this feature with any HTTP tool of your choice (e.g. postman or DHC).

  # unit tests for get_multiple_accounts
  # Get multiple accounts
  # Get a list of multiple bank accounts of the user that is authorized by the access_token. Must pass the accounts&#39; identifiers and the user&#39;s access_token. Accounts whose identifiers do not exist or do not relate to the authorized user will not be contained in the result (If this applies to all of the given identifiers, then the result will be an empty list). WARNING: This service is deprecated and will be removed at some point. If you want to get multiple accounts, please instead use the service &#39;Get and search all accounts&#39; and pass a comma-separated list of identifiers as a parameter &#39;ids&#39;.

  # unit tests for request_sepa_direct_debit
  # Request SEPA Direct Debit
  # Submit a SEPA direct debit order for one or multiple direct debits. Returns an instruction from the bank server that can be displayed to the user (e.g. \&quot;Enter TAN\&quot;), typically in the language of the bank&#39;s country. The order remains valid for execution for only a couple of minutes (the exact validity period depends on the bank). For executing the order, use the /executeSepaDirectDebit service after calling this service. Note that when the order is not executed within the validity period, the bank might take note of that and - if happening too often - ultimately lock the user&#39;s online banking access. If there already exists a previously submitted but not yet executed SEPA order for this account (either another direct debit order, or a money transfer order), then that order will be discarded and replaced with the new order that is being created with this service call.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Notes:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; When using a two-step-procedure with flag &#39;implicitExecute&#39; &#x3D; true, then this service will immediately execute the direct debit. The response will not contain any challenge message and you won&#39;t be required to make a subsequent call to /executeSepaDirectDebit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE: Depending on your license, this service may respond with HTTP code 451, containing an error message with a identifier of web form in it. In addition to that the response will also have included a &#39;Location&#39; header, which contains the URL to the web form. In this case, you must forward your user to finAPI&#39;s web form. For a detailed explanation of the Web Form Flow, please refer to this article: &lt;a href&#x3D;&#39;https://finapi.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002596391&#39; target&#x3D;&#39;_blank&#39;&gt;finAPI&#39;s Web Form Flow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that this service only works when your client has payments enabled (see client configuration).

You must display the challenge message to the user, and then retry the service call, passing the user&#39;s answer to the bank&#39;s challenge in the &#39;challengeResponse&#39; field.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; When using a two-step-procedure with flag &#39;implicitExecute&#39; &#x3D; true, then this service will immediately execute the money transfer.
