  # unit tests for create_notification_rule
  # Create a new notification rule
  # Create a new notification rule for a specific user. Must pass the user&#39;s access_token.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setting up notification rules for a user allows your client application to get notified about changes in the user&#39;s data, e.g. when new transactions were downloaded, an account&#39;s balance has changed, or the user&#39;s banking credentials are no longer correct. Note that currently, this feature is implemented only for finAPI&#39;s automatic batch update, i.e. notification rules are only relevant when the user has activated the automatic updates (and when the automatic batch update is activated in general for your client).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are different kinds of notification rules. The kind of a rule is depicted by the &#39;triggerEvent&#39;. The trigger event specifies what data you have to pass when creating a rule (specifically, the contents of the &#39;params&#39; field), on which events finAPI will send notifications to your client application, as well as what data is contained in those notifications. The specifics of the different trigger events are documented in the following article on our Dev Portal: &lt;a href&#x3D;&#39;https://finapi.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/232324608-How-to-create-notification-rules-and-receive-notifications&#39; target&#x3D;&#39;_blank&#39;&gt;How to create notification rules and receive notifications&lt;/a&gt;
