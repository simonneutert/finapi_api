  # Change the client_secret for any of your clients, including the mandator admin client.

User access tokens are not affected.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; finAPI is storing client secrets with a one-way encryption. A lost client secret can NOT be recovered.

  # unit tests for create_iban_rules
  # Create IBAN rules
  # This service can be used to define IBAN rules for finAPI&#39;s transaction categorization system. The transaction categorization is run automatically whenever new transactions are imported, as well as when you call the services &#39;Check categorization&#39; or &#39;Trigger categorization&#39;. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An IBAN rule maps an IBAN to a certain category. finAPI&#39;s categorization system will pick the category as a candidate for any transaction whose counterpart&#39;s account matches the IBAN. It is not guaranteed though that this candidate will actually be applied, as there could be other categorization rules that have higher priority or that are an even better match for the transaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that the rules that you define here will be applied to all of your users. They have higher priority than finAPI&#39;s default categorization rules, but lower priority than user-specific rules (User-specific rules are created implicitly whenever a category is manually assigned to a transaction via the PATCH /transactions services). IBAN rules have a higher priority than keyword rules (see the &#39;Create keyword rules&#39; service).

  # unit tests for create_keyword_rules
  # Create keyword rules
  # This service can be used to define keyword rules for finAPI&#39;s transaction categorization system. The transaction categorization is run automatically whenever new transactions are imported, as well as when you call the services &#39;Check categorization&#39; or &#39;Trigger categorization&#39;. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A keyword rule maps a set of keywords to a certain category. finAPI&#39;s categorization system will pick the category as a candidate for any transaction that contains at least one of the defined keywords in its purpose or counterpart information. It is not guaranteed though that this candidate will actually be applied, as there could be other categorization rules that have higher priority or that are an even better match for the transaction. If there are multiple keyword rules that match a transaction, finAPI will pick the one with the highest count of matched keywords.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that the rules that you define here will be applied to all of your users. They have higher priority than finAPI&#39;s default categorization rules, but lower priority than user-specific rules (User-specific rules are created implicitly whenever a category is manually assigned to a transaction via the PATCH /transactions services). Keyword rules have a lower priority than IBAN rules (see the &#39;Create IBAN rules&#39; service).

  # unit tests for delete_users
  # Delete users
  # Delete one or several users, which are specified by a given list of identifiers. Must pass the &lt;a href&#x3D;&#39;https://finapi.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003661827-Difference-between-app-clients-and-mandator-admin-client&#39; target&#x3D;&#39;_blank&#39;&gt;mandator admin client&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s access_token. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE&lt;/b&gt;: finAPI may fail to delete one (or several, or all) of the specified users. A user cannot get deleted when his data is currently locked by an internal process (for instance, update of a bank connection or transactions categorization). The response contains the identifiers of all users that could not get deleted, and all users that could get deleted, separated in two lists. The mandator admin client can retry the request at a later time for the users who could not get deleted.&lt;br/&gt; Note that non-existing user identifiers will be ignored entirely, meaning that those identifiers will not appear in the response at all.

NOTE: Due to its validation and visualization, the swagger frontend might show very low performance, or even crashes, when a service responds with a lot of data.

  # Get user list
  # &lt;p&gt;Get a list of the users of the mandator that is authorized by the access_token.

You can set optional search criteria to get only those users that you are interested in. If you do not specify any search criteria, then this service functions as a &#39;get all&#39; service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that the original user id is no longer available in finAPI once a user has been deleted. Because of this, the userId of deleted users will be a distorted version of the original userId. For example, if the deleted user&#39;s id was originally &#39;user&#39;, then this service will return &#39;uXXr&#39; as the userId.&lt;/p&gt;

  # @option opts [String] :monthly_stats_start_date Minimum bound for the monthly stats (&#x3D;oldest month that should be included). Must be passed in the format &#39;YYYY-MM&#39;. If not specified, then the monthly stats will go back up to the first month in which the user existed (date of the user&#39;s registration). Note that this field is only regarded if &#39;includeMonthlyStats&#39; &#x3D; true.
  # @option opts [String] :monthly_stats_end_date Maximum bound for the monthly stats (&#x3D;latest month that should be included). Must be passed in the format &#39;YYYY-MM&#39;. If not specified, then the monthly stats will go up to either the current month (for active users), or up to the month of deletion (for deleted users). Note that this field is only regarded if  &#39;includeMonthlyStats&#39; &#x3D; true.
  # @option opts [Integer] :min_bank_connection_count_in_monthly_stats A value of X means that the service will return only those users which had at least X bank connections imported at any time within the returned monthly stats set.
